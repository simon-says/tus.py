pip install -U tus.py
```

# Usage (command line)
This command will upload a single file to the server:

tus-upload \
    example.bin \
    https://upload.example.com/files/ \
    --header authorization 'token foo' \

FILE_PATH = 'example.bin'
TUS_ENDPOINT = 'https://upload.example.com/files/'
HEADERS = {'Authorization': 'token foo'}
CHUNK_SIZE = 256000

with open(FILE_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    tus.upload(
    	f,
        TUS_ENDPOINT,
